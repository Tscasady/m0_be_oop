# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  - It felt good. It was satisfying to pull together multiple lessons and ideas to create code that felt new and dynamic. Documentation can still be intimidating to read at times but the research I did and experiments I made were fruitful.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  - I sometimes forget to take breaks but only because I felt very focused and productive during this exercise. Eventually it catches up with me but I never put it off to a catastrophic extent.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

  - I feel ready. I would like to continue to practice during the time leading up to mod1, especially if I can coordinate times to work with my mod0 peers. Continuing to practice seems necessary to help these new skills, mindsets, and habits stick.
